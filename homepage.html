                <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish that was thought to have originated from ancient Iran before settling in modern India.
                     It is made with rice, some type of meat and spices. To cater to vegetarians,
                     in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables for the meat. Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are added.</p>

                <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, 
                    and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour,
                    or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, 
                    or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.</p>
