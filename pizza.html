                <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Step: Make the dough: In a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Stir until the yeast is dissolved. Let stand for 5 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy. </li>
                    <li>Step: Add the flour, salt, and remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the yeast mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.                    </li>
                    <li>Step: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. If the dough is too dry, add a little more water, 1 teaspoon at a time. </li>
                    <li>Step: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.                    </li>
                    <li>Step: Make the sauce: In a medium saucepan, combine the crushed tomatoes, olive oil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook for 15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly. </li>
                    <li>Step: Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat. </li>
                    <li>Step: Assemble the pizza: Punch down the dough and divide it in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one half of the dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured pizza peel or baking sheet. </li>
                    <li>Step: Spread ¼ cup of sauce over the dough, leaving a ½-inch border around the edge. Top with ½ cup of mozzarella cheese and your choice of toppings. </li>
                    <li>Step: Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                    <li>Step: Repeat steps 7-9 with the remaining dough and sauce.</li>
